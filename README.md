# PES_JackFruitProblem_SEM1
A Python-based command-line healthcare application that performs age group analysis, symptom-based illness checking, BMI calculation, and appointment token generation using CSV data.

🏥 Healthcare Management & Symptom Analysis System (Python)

This project is a Python-based command-line healthcare application developed as an academic mini project. It combines patient data analysis, basic illness symptom checking, BMI calculation, and appointment token generation into a single integrated program.

The application is designed to demonstrate the use of Python programming, CSV file handling, conditional logic, and data analysis using Pandas in a healthcare-related context.

🔹 Features
📊 Age Group Analysis

Reads patient data from a CSV file (fake_patient.csv)

Categorizes patients into predefined age groups:

Child, Teen, Young Adult, Middle Age, Senior

Displays:

Age group distribution

Percentage of patients in each group

🧾 Appointment Token Generator

Accepts number of patients and their names

Automatically assigns sequential appointment tokens

Saves the token list to a CSV file (AppointmentTokens.csv)

Useful for managing patient queues

🩺 General Illness Symptom Checker

Interactive symptom-based checker using user input

Asks questions related to:

Fever, cough, cold

Gastric symptoms

Dengue-like symptoms

Dehydration indicators

Emergency red flags

Uses rule-based logic to identify the closest matching illness

Provides general health advice

Includes a clear medical disclaimer

⚖ BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator

Calculates BMI using user height and weight

Supports unit conversion:

kg ↔ lbs

cm ↔ meters

Categorizes BMI into:

Underweight

Normal weight

Overweight

Obese

Displays:

BMI value

BMI category (with colored terminal output)

Ideal weight range

Personalized lifestyle suggestions

🔹 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – CSV file handling and data analysis

Command Line Interface (CLI)

CSV files – Data input and output

🔹 Project Highlights

Modular structure with reusable functions

Demonstrates real-world healthcare use cases

Uses conditional logic to simulate medical decision-making

Includes data storage and retrieval using CSV files

Terminal-based UI with colored output for better readability
